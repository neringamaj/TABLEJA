<H1>TABLEO</H1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>TABLEO is a locally hosted website that revolutionizes the way users discover restaurants. At the heart of TABLEO is an adaptive chatbot, powered by ChatGPT 3.5, designed to engage in natural, flowing conversations. The chatbot meticulously gathers user preferences to generate precise queries to a vector database, ensuring the best possible restaurant match. If a location isn’t found in the database, TABLEO employs the Google Places API to enrich its database with new information. This feature not only expands the database but also ensures up-to-date recommendations. For users with specific standards, TABLEO’s conversational AI is adept at refining searches to pinpoint the perfect dining experience.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>This project, TABLEO, stands as a testament to collaborative innovation and the power of teamwork. It was brought to life by the dedication and expertise of a team of talented students, and it thrived under the guidance of a supportive learning environment and an industry challenge.

Our journey in developing TABLEO was significantly enriched and guided by the "Inovacijų dirbtuvės" workshop hosted by VITP. Their workshops provided us with the foundational knowledge and inspiration needed to tackle this project with confidence and creativity.

We also wish to express our sincere appreciation to the company "TABLĖJA" for presenting us with the challenge to innovate restaurant reservation systems using AI. Their vision and support have been crucial in turning this project into a reality.

This project is not just a culmination of our hard work; it represents the synergy of educational initiatives, industry challenges, and the boundless potential of young innovators.
